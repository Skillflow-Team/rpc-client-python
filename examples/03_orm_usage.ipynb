    "This notebook will look into integrating the Turing SDK by implementing the `ShortAnswerQuestion` object into an ORM model. For the purpose of simplicity, we will use the Django ORM in this notebook. However, as you will see, this integration works regardless of your ORM choice.\n",

    "To grade questions with Turing, you need to implement the two stages of the question grading lifecycle:\n",
    "1. **Question object creation**\n",
    "2. **Question grading request**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every request for question grading must address these two steps in one way or another. First, let's worry about creating a question object. As the name of this notebook suggests, we are going to create questions via an ORM model. To do this, we can implement an method on the ORM model, which utitlizes the fields of the model to create a `ShortAnswerQuestion` object.\n",
